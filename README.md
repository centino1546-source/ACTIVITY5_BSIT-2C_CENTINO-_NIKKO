# Stacks and Queues

**Name:** Centino, Nikko Andre T.  
**Course, Year, and Section:** BSIT - 2C

## About
This program shows how stacks and queues work using arrays and linked lists. It also has a parentheses checker and a small print queue program.

## Files
- `array_stack.py` — stack made with a fixed-size list.
- `linked_stack.py` — stack made with linked nodes.
- `array_queue.py` — circular queue made with a fixed-size list.
- `linked_queue.py` — queue with front and rear nodes.
- `main.py` — menu for testing the four data structures.
- `balanced_parentheses.py` — checks matching parentheses, brackets, and braces.
- `print_queue.py` — adds and prints jobs in first-in, first-out order.
- `analysis.md` — answers the analysis question.
- `sample_runs.md` — example outputs for testing.

## Requirements
Python 3 is required. No extra packages are needed.

## Run the programs
Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the parentheses checker:

```bash
python balanced_parentheses.py
```

To run the print queue:

```bash
python print_queue.py
```

## Things to test
- Push more than three items into the Array Stack to see overflow.
- Pop from an empty stack to see underflow.
- Enqueue more than three items into the Circular Array Queue to see overflow.
- Dequeue from an empty queue to see underflow.
- For queue wrap-around, enqueue A, B, C; dequeue A and B; then enqueue D and E. The order should be C, D, E.
- Try `({[]})` and `({[})` in the parentheses checker.
- Add several print jobs and check that the first job added prints first.

The lab instructions ask for individual files in the GitHub repository. Upload the files, not only this ZIP file.
